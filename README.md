SCA-PatternBOX readme
---------------------

SCA-PatterBox is a design pattern editor for SCA-java service-oriented applications. 
It is an extension of the existing Eclipse plug-in PatternBox (www.patternbox.com/).
We extended the existing Eclipse-plugin PatternBox by modifying the grammar module "templates.dtd" within the PatternBox directory "template.java" 
to allow the use of Java annotations for SCA into the code
templates, and the source code of PatternBox to generate Java code from the pattern code
templates 
with the appropriate annotations for SCA.
SCA-PatternBOX also allows to generate ASM code from SCA-ASM template. The realization of this features is still in progress.
